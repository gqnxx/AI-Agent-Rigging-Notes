# 🛡️ Agentic-Systems-Hardening-Blueprints

## Mission Overview

**If you're reading this, congrats! You found my personal workspace.** 👋 I'm writing this down as a quick reference guide and paranoia log for myself, but feel free to check out the blueprints.

This documentation tracks my progress through the **Google AI Agents: From Prototype to Production** course on Kaggle.

The core objective is engineering scalable, reliable, and functional **Agentic Systems** by critically analyzing and addressing security risks across the entire system lifecycle. This includes applying principles of defense-in-depth and establishing robust control planes.

## Course Structure & Technical Focus Areas

The content is organized into daily modules, reflecting the process of moving an agent from a simple prototype to an enterprise-grade solution.

### Day 1: Foundational Agents (Building the Core)

**Engineering Focus:** Establishing the core "Think, Act, Observe" loop and the architecture of both Single and Multi-Agent Systems.
- **Details:** [Day_1_README.md](Day_1_README.md)

### Day 2: Memory and Context Management (Data Flow Integrity)

**Engineering Focus:** Designing the memory system (RAG) to ensure the agent uses correct, grounded, and authorized data sources efficiently.
- **Details:** [Day_2_README.md](Day_2_README.md)

### Day 3: Quality and Reliability (Operational Integrity)

**Engineering Focus:** Implementing **Agent Ops** to measure performance, debug complex decisions (Tracing), and ensure the agent consistently meets quality standards.
- **Details:** [Day_3_README.md](Day_3_README.md)

### Day 4: Architecture and Scaling (Governance and Control)

**Engineering Focus:** Planning deployment and establishing **Control Planes** to manage a large fleet of agents and tools in a production environment.
- **Details:** [Day_4_README.md](Day_4_README.md)

### Day 5: Defense and Authorization (System Hardening)

**Engineering Focus:** Hardening the agent against external manipulation and implementing strong authorization controls (Identity and Access Policies).
- **Details:** [Day_5_README.md](Day_5_README.md)
